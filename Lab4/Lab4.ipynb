    "Dates in R, like any other programming language, can be fairly complicated and need to be handled a special way. When you give R something like \"10/02/2002\", you may think it's obvious that this a date. But R just views this as a regular string type, in other words a piece of text like \"taco cat\". You have to explicitly tell R how to handle these strings so that they are stored properly. For instance is the format of this date MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY? But once you tell R this is a date and it has this format, then doing fairly complex operations on it become much easier (e.g. what day of the week is 03/12/2045? What is the date for 02/10/2060 + 60 days?).\n",
