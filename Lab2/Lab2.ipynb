    "\n",
    "* ggplot(): Tells R that we want to plot something\n",
    "* labs(): Defines the labels on a plot (e.g. labs(x=\"x label\", y=\"y label\", title=\"title\", subtitle=\"subtitle\"))\n",
    "* geom_point(): Tells R that we want to use points to plot the data (e.g. scatter plot)\n",
    "    * color: use this argument to set the color\n",
    "    * size: use this argument to set the size of the points\n",
    "    * position: normally you would set this to \"jitter\" if you want all the points to be viewable\n",
    "* facet_grid(): Uses categorical variables in the \"row ~ column\" format to plot previous geoms for each category\n",
    "* face_wrap(): Very similar to facet_grid(), but only displays overlapping categories that have data, and can manipulate the size of the grid output.\n",
    "    * nrow, ncol: Defines the number of rows and column the plot should be\n",
    "* geom_smooth(): Plots a best fit line for the given data with a confidence interval by default\n",
    "    * linetype: Use categorical variable to split into multiple lines\n",
    "    * se: Boolean to define if confidence interval should be displayed\n",
    "    * group: Use categorical variable to split line into different colors\n",
    "* geom_bar(): Plots a bar chart, default aggregation (or statistic) is going to be a count of each category of x\n",
    "    * stat: Default here is \"count\", but if a y variable is to be used, change this to \"identity\"\n",
    "    * fill: Tells R what color to fill the bar with (normally use a variable)\n",
    "    * color: Tells R what color to outline the bars with\n",
    "    * position: Tells R where to position the bars, \"dodge\" will make side by side bars, \"fill\" makes proportions\n",
    "* geom_boxplot(): Plots a boxplot, note that the x variable has to be categorical and the y variable has to be quantitative.\n",
