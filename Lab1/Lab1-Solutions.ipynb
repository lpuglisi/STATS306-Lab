    "    + Each column is a variable\n",
    "    + Each row is an observation\n",
    "3. **Transform** - Filtering data set down, create new variables, calculate summary statistics\n",
    "4. **Visualize** - Create plots to find interesting things about the data\n",
    "5. **Model** - Based on the visualizations you have created, the data will hint at the models to use (e.g. based on the scatter plot regression looks appropiate, based on the summary statistics classification could be relevant, etc.)\n",
    "6. **Communicate** - Using the findings from the previous steps, you will need to communicate what you have found (e.g. looking at the sales data from our mobile app, it looks like millenials are most likely to buy product A in the next quarter)\n",
